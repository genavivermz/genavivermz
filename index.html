    <h3>Genavive Ramirez</h3>
    <p>Hello! I'm Genavive, an incoming college freshman from SoCal. I'm interested in combining computational and creative thinking 
      to improve the entrepreneurial experience for busy, ambitious founders! You can usually find me testing new coffee flavors at Dunkin' or
    strolling through the classics, fiction, and science sections at bookstores! </p>
    <p>Currently, I'm dedicated to extending my knowledge in nonprofit leadership through my website Bobigos.com.
      With Bobigos (Boba + Amigos), I help over 10,000 users raise goods remotely for their organizations!
    As someone who learned to balance over 50 hours/week of family responsibilities with my entrepreneurial interests, Bobigos is how I've 
    been able to take what I've learned as a non-traditional founder and apply my core values to others through the boundless nature of technology.
    </p>
      <p>If you're interested in working with me on this new modality of impact, reach out to me via genavivers08@gmail.com!</p>
